<h2 align=center class="main">Reply To Comment On arXiv:2112.09706<br> </h2>

<p class="main">This webpage is in the tradition of the "reply to comment on", except without the arXiv identifiers. In the interest of keeping the focus on the work, which is available on the arXiv with identifier <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09706">2112.09706</a>, and which I continue to stand behind without reservation, I will strictly refer to the author of the "comment on" as the Twitter interlocutor (TI).
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="termheading">Background</p>
<p class="talk">The context is that my collaborators and I sent TI a draft of our paper ahead of time, knowing well that he'd be upset by our findings. He requested a number of changes, almost all of which we corresponded about and eventually honored, leading us to make (barely perceptible but nonzero) changes to two of our main results plots, to add an appendix, to change some wording (including in the abstract), and even add the word "multi-messenger" in the title for clarity. My coauthors and I considered one of their requests to be "outside the scope of this work" (comparing against a set of non-publicly available templates), but we said we'd address it before submitting to a journal. They didn't reply to that proposal, which I interpreted to mean it satisfied them. The topics covered in this Twitter thread were never brought up in the email exchange.<br>
<br>So I would like to stress that my collaborators and I tried as hard as we could to keep this material private by engaging TI in an email exchange before posting our paper. TI violated a degree of professional decorum by publicly making further complaints (responses below, though I feel the scientific disagreement is not the real point) unrelated to the many complaints he made (and we addressed) in our initial exchange. Before making this page public, I requested that these tweets be removed, because I thought the optimal outcome would be (and still think it could be) for them not to exist at all. If the tweets are removed, this webpage will be as well.

<p class="termheading">Response to Various Claims, Dec 21</p>
<p class="talk">TI claims: <i>They didn't actually test whether it's their diffuse maps or their immense mask that causes the favoring of NFW over the stellar bulge templates. Unfortunately, they rushed to put it out before they could do that test. It's kind of an important one...</i><br>We tested and characterized our mask choices more extensively than previous work. In Table III, pg 13, we show the fraction of the sky that is covered by the mask. It is "immense" only at the lowest energies -- an energy range in which, indeed, our final results have correspondingly less discriminating power -- decreasing in coverage monotonically with energy. Already at the bin centered at 700 MeV, which is the only energy range in which we claim to find anything conclusive, the mask covers less than about a third of the sky. We test other masks in App A, Fig 19, pg 31, which is, in fact, a more comprehensive test of masks than in any other comparable work I am aware of. And there we show that there is a correlation between the mask and the inferred ellipticity parameter, which we think is an intriguing basis for future work.<br>
<br>TI claims: <i>It's cherry picking to decide to exclude some data that could change one's conclusion, no? There's also their immense point source mask.</i><br>I <b>completely</b> reject the notion that we cherry picked data. We used all data passing minimal quality cuts, and we agreed on all of the mask and analysis choices well in advance (following our earlier work). We tested alternate masks in the appendices, which, as mentioned above, exceeds the standard established in previous works.<br>
</p>
<p class="termheading">Response to Various Claims, Dec 23</p>
<p class="talk"><br>TI says: <i>It's a poor paper that took many shortcuts. They fail to model the inner 2 degrees, they mask point sources instead of modeling them throwing away a ton of data in both choices, and they use old inverse Compton models (no rings).</i><br>These are intentional and well-motivated choices -- other authors in other analyses are perfectly free to make other choices. But the questions our paper is predominantly interested in asking are about differences at several degrees: are we able to make good global fits to the gamma ray sky <b>plus</b> new cosmic ray data? Do we find an excess in the same energy range as other analyses? And if so, does the excess trace stellar material (e.g., the bulges) or something spherically symmetric? Thus, we remove the inner 2 degrees because, despite this being where the largest number of photons are, this is where: any mismodeling of the gas has the greatest statistical impact, the largest number of bright undetected point sources still exist, and the difference between the bulges and the spherically symmetric profile is relatively smallest. Our analysis instead looks only at relatively quiet and well-understood sky locations where the difference in these shapes is relatively larger. Finally, we <i>do</i> include rings insofar as we generate a large number of galactic diffuse models, some of which account for ring-like molecular hydrogen gas distributions, though our rings are constrained by fluid conservation laws, which is the core assumption of GALPROP -- not including <i>freely normalized</i> rings in our ICS models is tantamount to assuming steady-state cosmic ray diffusion throughout the galaxy. The photons we model are therefore those from steady-state diffusion of cosmic rays, which is necessarily one part of the diffuse background. Other non-steady state contributions can be fit by including additional rings with additional parameter freedom, although we believe it is better to test this possibility through explicit Green-function like injections of physical cosmic ray bursts. In addition, the fact that the excess we find traces a spherically symmetric (or slightly prolate) NFW squared profile <i>rather than</i> stellar mass (or other perturbations on that shape) is <b>evidence that this steady-state assumption is good in the ROI we investigate</b>. And even after pointing out these differences, we stress that the text of our paper makes plain that <i>we consider the possibility that GCE itself may be the result of burst activity from the galactic center</i>, and in the paper we do not make strong claims about the existence or non-existence of such burst activity. We agree that it is interesting to interrogate this further, and intend to do so soon (even though there are no currently publicly available templates that we can test against).<br>
<br>TI says: <i>Plus, they make claims about other works' diffuse models without actually testing those claims, and that's just plain misleading.</i>I honestly can't think of what he means -- we keep our editorializing to a minimum (and wish TI to do the same).
</p>
<p class="termheading">In Conclusion</p>
<p class="main">The work my collaborators and I have done was careful, methodical, and, ultimately, fair. We kept an open mind to our results until the very end, we performed a great many tests and cross tests, and I believe we came up with a number of exciting new results that I think establish grounds for new tests of the origin of this exciting -- and still mysterious -- natural phenomenon.
